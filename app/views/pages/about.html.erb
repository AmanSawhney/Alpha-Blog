	<p>I am a 16 year old student who has been working with technology my entire life and love it. I was first introduced to technology when I got my first dell computer. While playing online games at places like miniclip.com, I began to fall in love with programming. My father taught me my first language in order to learn the fundamentals of computer programming. Then, I began to learn Python. With that under my belt, I built scripts in order to scrape the web for information. Then, in the summer of 2014, I attended the FlatIron School for web development. I got my hands dirty with CSS, HTML, and Ruby. Ruby is my second favorite lanuage so I use it as backend for the servers that keep my IOS apps alive. After my attendance at the FlatIron school, I began doing work for a company in New York called Blue Matrix. There, I worked on setting up 10 gigabit NICs for deployment. Afterwards, I learned C++ to further my skill set. In the summer of 2015, I attended the Make School summer program. I learned Swift and began my journey of app development. After, we are in the present. Right now I have made a few iPhone applications.

	<h1 align="center" class="question"><small>Why does this exist? </small></h1>
	<br>
	<p>
			I made this because I felt my web development skills were lacking so I decided to expand my knowledge by following the Udemy Ruby on Rails course.
